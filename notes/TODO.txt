Solve concurrency issue in JdbcPoolingDataSource.markUnavailable()


Need test and driver support for sybase and informix
Need driver support for MS-SQL server drivers


I have modified BasePoolingDataSource to propigate get/set/clear properties to the origin
data source where appropriate. I now need to add tests to as400 tests to ensure it works
as desired.

Provide a means to specify what the test timeout period should be. Connection.isValid()
supports a number of seconds it should timeout at. At present I have it hard coded to
2 seconds. It would be nice to allow the user to specify. The down side of course is
that has no meaning on the AS400 object as it doesn't support a timeout.

Replace COUNT with LongAdder impl. Needs to be back ported from JDK 8 to JDK 6 for
this library.











Whenever a connection is requested from the pool I want to capture a stack trace of the
calling thread and store it with the connection. At any time via JMX I should be able to
list all connections the pool has opened and are not yet closed. From that list I should
be able to tell what connections are busy and which are idle. Of the busy threads I
should be capable of determining how long they have been active and I should be able to
obtain the most recent stack trace.



Replace all calls to TimeProvider.get() with injected providers. I have changed my mind about
how I want to do this. Ultimately, the supplying of those TimeProviders needs to be transparent
from the main usage pattern. One option is to make SystemTimeProvider impl the stub method etc
and then when you call millisTime it look up the stub and returns its value if present otherwise
it uses the System.currentTimeMillis(). With that model the TimeProvider class becomes an
interface.
